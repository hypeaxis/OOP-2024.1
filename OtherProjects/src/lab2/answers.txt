When should accessor methods be used? 
• When we need to enforce some sort of invariant or validation rule on the value being set 
• When we need to hide the internal representation of an object and provide a more abstract 
interface to it 
• When we need to provide read-only access to a property or attribute 

Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to

parameter lists. It’s called constructor overloading.
